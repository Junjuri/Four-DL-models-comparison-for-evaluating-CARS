Vartiainen](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zbxe2qYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) 

These four models are different from each other viz, convolutional neural network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, very deep convolutional autoencoders (VECTOR), and Bi-directional LSTM (Bi â€“ LSTM) neural network.

## Getting Started and Requirements 
You can use Python (TensorFlow 2.7.0) to test the pre-trained network. We have tested it in Spyder.
